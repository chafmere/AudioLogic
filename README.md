# AudioLogic

### An Audio Log plugin for Godot 4.X

AudioLogic is an addon for [Godot 4](https://godotengine.org/) that provides an easy way to add Audio logs into your game.

This addon is not yet available in the Asset Library and is in the early stages of development.

You can install by cloning the repo and pasting the addons folder into your project (or the audiologic folder if you already have addons). Then you can enable the plugin via the project settings.
